The command line is a way you can operate/navigate your computer the same way you would use your mouse. Except you are using specific written commands instead of clicking.
ls: gives you a snapshot of where you are in your computer
cd: (change directory) change to a different place on your computer
cd ..: move up a level in folders
touch: add file
mkdir: add folder
rm -r: delete folder
git add: (track) register the changes you have made
git commit -m: save changes in folder with a message of what you've done
git status: check which changes are registered and saved
git push: sync changes with the master branch
